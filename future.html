  <p2>In the future I hope to pursue my love of computer science. I am applying to colleges this year as a computer science major and I hope that I can do a double major in computer science and business! As a girl who codes I hope that I can inspire other young girls to foster their interest in STEM fields. I am working with the head of the computer science department at my high school to plan outreach programs into our local elementary and middle schools to encourage other young females to pursue their interests. I am hoping that the girls who code community spreads and that the future only brings a larger sisterhood of coders.</p2>
